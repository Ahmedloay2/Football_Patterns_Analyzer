## 🎯 Overview

This system analyzes football match event data to:
1. **Extract tactical plays** from raw event sequences
2. **Engineer features** that capture tactical characteristics
3. **Cluster similar plays** using hierarchical clustering
4. **Generate descriptive names** for each tactical pattern
5. **Provide interactive exploration** through a GUI
6. **Visualize plays** on football field diagrams
7. **Compare plays** side-by-side with detailed metrics

### What is a "Play"?

A **play** is defined as a sequence of events by a single team that:
- **Starts** with a forward pass (PA event)
- **Contains** at least 2 passes (PA or CR - cross events)
- **Ends in the attacking third** (final ball position must be x ≥ 20 in normalized coordinates)
- **Ends** with a terminal event:
  - Possession lost (team changes, LO, CA, TA events)
  - Shot taken (SH event - may result in GOAL)
- **Same team** maintains possession throughout
- **Intermediate events** (dribbles, touches, etc.) are included but don't count toward the pass requirement
- **Minimum forward progress** if starting in defensive third (≥5 meters)

**Field Positioning:**
The system divides the pitch into three zones:
- **Defensive third**: x ≤ -16.67 (own half defensive zone)
- **Middle third**: -16.67 < x < 16.67 (midfield zone)
- **Attacking third**: x ≥ 16.67 (opponent's defensive zone)

Only plays ending in the attacking third are extracted to focus on genuine attacking patterns.

**Example Play:**
```
Pass (PA) → Dribble (DR) → Pass (PA) → Touch (IT) → Shot (SH) at x=25 ✓ VALID (2 passes + shot in attacking third)
Pass (PA) → Pass (PA) → Team Change at x=22 ✓ VALID (2 passes + possession lost in attacking third)
Pass (PA) → Shot (SH) ✗ INVALID (only 1 pass)
Pass (PA) → Pass (PA) → Shot (SH) at x=10 ✗ INVALID (not in attacking third)
```

### SOLID Principles Implementation

#### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
Each module has one clear purpose:
- `config.py` → Manages configuration settings
- `models.py` → Defines data structures
- `data_loader.py` → Loads and parses data
- `feature_engineer.py` → Calculates features
- `clustering.py` → Performs clustering
- `visualizer.py` → Creates visualizations
- `browser.py` → Provides interactive interface

#### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Easy to add new event types without modifying existing code
- New clustering algorithms can be added by extending `PlayClusterer`
- New features can be added in `feature_engineer.py` without breaking existing features

#### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- All components work with abstract interfaces
- `PlayExtractor`, `PlayClusterer`, `FeatureEngineer` can be replaced with alternative implementations

#### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- Small, focused classes with minimal public methods
- GUI components separate from core analysis logic

#### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- Components depend on configuration objects, not hardcoded values
- Easy to test with mock configurations
- Database/storage layer abstracted through `PathConfig`

## 🔍 Play Definition & Extraction Algorithm

### Algorithm Overview (`src/data_loader.py`)

The play extraction uses a **sliding window** approach:

```python
def extract_plays(events):
    """
    Scan through all events looking for valid play sequences.
    """
    plays = []
    i = 0
    
    while i < len(events):
        # Try to extract a play starting from position i
        play_data = try_extract_play(events, i)
        
        if play_data:
            play, next_idx = play_data
            plays.append(play)
            i = next_idx  # Jump to end of this play
        else:
            i += 1  # Move to next event
    
    return plays
```

### Detailed Extraction Logic

**Step 1: Find Starting Point**
- Scan for forward pass (PA event)
- Verify pass direction matches team's attack direction
- Calculate attack direction based on:
  - Stadium metadata
  - Team (home/away)
  - Period (1st/2nd half)

**Step 2: Collect Same-Team Events**
```python
while current_event.team_id == starting_team_id:
    # Add event to play
    
    if event_type in ['PA', 'CR']:
        pass_count += 1
        
    if event_type in ['SH', 'LO', 'CA', 'TA']:
        # Terminal event - check if valid play
        if pass_count >= 2:
            create_play()
        break
```

**Step 3: Validation**
- **Minimum passes:** 2 (configurable in `config.py`)
- **Duration:** 3-30 seconds (configurable)
- **Forward progress:** ≥5 meters (configurable)

**Step 4: Play Creation**
- Extract all metadata (team, match, time)
- Calculate features (see Feature Engineering)
- Normalize coordinates to standard field orientation
- Determine outcome (GOAL, SHOT, POSSESSION_LOST, etc.)

### Why This Definition?

This definition captures **meaningful attacking sequences**:
- **2+ passes** filters out simple turnovers
- **Terminal event** ensures plays have clear outcomes
- **Same team** requirement maintains tactical coherence
- **Intermediate events** preserve full context (dribbles, touches)

---

## 🧮 Feature Engineering

### Features Calculated (`src/feature_engineer.py`)

The system calculates **21 features** per play grouped into 5 categories:

#### 1. **Event Type Counts** (8 dimensions)
One-hot encoding of common event types:
- PA (Pass), SH (Shot), CR (Cross), IT (Interception/Touch)
- LO (Loss), CA (Clearance), DR (Dribble), TC (Touch)

#### 2. **Spatial Features** (6 dimensions)
| Feature | Description | Calculation | Tactical Meaning |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| `delta_x` | Forward progress | `final_x - initial_x` | Penetration depth |
| `delta_y` | Lateral movement | `abs(final_y - initial_y)` | Width of attack |
| `max_x` | Deepest penetration | `max(all_x_coords)` | Threat level |
| `total_distance` | Ball travel distance | `Σ√(Δx² + Δy²)` | Play complexity |
| `num_events` | Event count | Integer | Play length |
| `duration` | Play length | Seconds | Tempo |

#### 3. **Starting Position Features** (2 dimensions)
| Feature | Description | Tactical Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `start_x` | Horizontal starting position | Identifies build-up zone |
| `start_y` | Absolute lateral starting position | Distinguishes wing vs center starts |

#### 4. **Trajectory Shape Features** (2 dimensions)
| Feature | Description | Calculation | Meaning |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `y_variance` | Lateral movement variance | `var(all_y_coords)` | Straight vs diagonal path |
| `final_y` | Ending lateral position | `abs(final_y)` | Wing vs center finish |

#### 5. **Tactical Features** (3 dimensions)
| Feature | Description | Calculation | Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| `avg_attackers_ahead` | Offensive support | `mean(attackers ahead of ball)` | Formation analysis |
| `avg_defenders_ahead` | Defensive pressure | `max(1, mean(defenders ahead))` | Resistance level (min 1 for GK) |
| `wing_side` | Attack position | `'WING' if abs(y) > 15 else 'CENTER'` | Positional categorization |

**Note:** The `avg_defenders_ahead` is guaranteed to be at least 1, accounting for the goalkeeper who is always present.

### Feature Vector Construction

For clustering, features are combined into a **21-dimensional vector**:

```python
def get_feature_vector(play):
    """
    21-dimensional feature vector for clustering.
    """
    return np.array([
        # Event type counts (8)
        count_PA, count_SH, count_CR, count_IT,
        count_LO, count_CA, count_DR, count_TC,
        # Spatial features (6)
        play.delta_x, play.delta_y, play.max_x,
        play.total_distance, play.num_events, play.duration,
        # Starting position (2)
        start_x, start_y,
        # Trajectory shape (2)
        y_variance, final_y,
        # Tactical features (3)
        play.avg_attackers_ahead, play.avg_defenders_ahead,
        1.0 if play.wing_side == 'WING' else 0.0
    ])
```

---

## 🎯 Clustering Algorithm

### Method: Hierarchical Clustering (`src/clustering.py`)

The system uses **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering** with **Ward's linkage**:

```python
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, fcluster
from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist

# Calculate pairwise distances
distance_matrix = pdist(feature_matrix, metric='euclidean')

# Build linkage tree using Ward's method
linkage_matrix = linkage(distance_matrix, method='ward')

# Cut tree at threshold
cluster_labels = fcluster(linkage_matrix, 
                         t=clustering_threshold,
                         criterion='distance')
```

### Why Hierarchical Clustering?

✅ **Advantages:**
- No need to specify number of clusters beforehand
- Produces dendrogram showing hierarchical relationships
- Works well with Euclidean distance in tactical feature space
- Ward's method minimizes within-cluster variance

❌ **Limitations:**
- O(n² log n) time complexity
- Sensitive to outliers
- Can't undo merges

### Clustering Pipeline

**Step 1: Filter Plays**
```python
valid_plays = [p for p in plays if p.delta_x >= min_forward_progress]
```

**Step 2: Extract Features**
```python
feature_matrix = np.array([get_feature_vector(p) for p in valid_plays])
```

**Step 3: Cluster**
```python
cluster_labels = hierarchical_clustering(feature_matrix, threshold)
```

**Step 4: Filter Small Clusters**
```python
# Remove clusters with < 2 plays
filtered = {cid: plays for cid, plays in clusters.items() if len(plays) >= 2}
```

**Step 5: Renumber & Sort**
```python
# Sort by cluster size (largest first)
# Renumber sequentially: 1, 2, 3, ...
```

### Cluster Naming Algorithm

Clusters are automatically named based on characteristics:

```python
def generate_cluster_name(plays):
    """
    Create descriptive name from play statistics.
    
    Format: [Position] [Speed] [Depth] [Conversion]
    Example: "Wing Attack Fast Deep High-Conv"
    """
    # Position (wing_side >= 70% threshold)
    if wing_pct >= 0.7:
        position = "Wing Attack"
    elif wing_pct <= 0.3:
        position = "Central Attack"
    else:
        position = "Mixed Attack"
    
    # Speed (duration thresholds)
    if avg_duration < 5:
        speed = "Fast"
    elif avg_duration > 10:
        speed = "Slow Build"
    else:
        speed = "Medium"
    
    # Depth (forward progress)
    if avg_forward > 30:
        depth = "Deep"
    elif avg_forward > 20:
        depth = "Mid"
    else:
        depth = "Short"
    
    # Conversion (goal rate)
    if goal_rate >= 0.3:
        conversion = "High-Conv"
    elif goal_rate > 0:
        conversion = "Low-Conv"
    
    return f"{position} {speed} {depth} {conversion}"
```

**Example Names:**
- "Wing Attack Fast Deep High-Conv" → Quick wing plays that score
- "Central Attack Slow Build Mid" → Patient buildup through center
- "Mixed Attack Medium Short Low-Conv" → Varied short attacks

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Adding New Features

**In `src/feature_engineer.py`:**

```python
def _calculate_custom_feature(self, play: Play):
    """Add your custom feature."""
    # Example: Calculate average pass distance
    pass_distances = []
    for i in range(len(play.events) - 1):
        if play.events[i].event_type == 'PA':
            dx = play.events[i+1].ball_x - play.events[i].ball_x
            dy = play.events[i+1].ball_y - play.events[i].ball_y
            dist = np.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
            pass_distances.append(dist)
    
    play.avg_pass_distance = np.mean(pass_distances) if pass_distances else 0
```

**In `src/utils.py`:**

```python
def get_feature_vector(play: Play) -> np.ndarray:
    """Add to feature vector."""
    return np.array([
        # ... existing features ...
        play.avg_pass_distance,  # NEW FEATURE
    ])
```

### Adding New Event Types

**In `src/data_loader.py`:**

```python
# Add to terminal events list
if event_type in ['SH', 'LO', 'CA', 'TA', 'NEW_EVENT']:
    # Handle new terminal event
```

### Changing Cluster Naming

**In `src/clustering.py`:**

```python
def _generate_cluster_name(self, plays: List[Play]) -> str:
    """Custom naming logic."""
    # Add your own naming criteria
    if avg_passes > 5:
        return "Long Possession Pattern"
    # ...
```

### Custom Distance Metrics

**In `src/clustering.py`:**

```python
# Replace Euclidean with custom metric
from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist

def custom_distance(u, v):
    # Your custom distance calculation
    return np.sum(np.abs(u - v))  # Manhattan distance example

distance_matrix = pdist(feature_matrix, metric=custom_distance)
```

## 📊 Algorithm Tuning

### Optimizing Cluster Quality

#### Problem: Too Many Small Clusters
**Solution:**
- ✅ Increase `clustering_threshold` (e.g., 15.0 → 20.0)
- ✅ Increase `min_forward_progress` (filter more plays)
- ✅ Reduce feature dimensionality (fewer features)

#### Problem: Clusters Too Broad
**Solution:**
- ✅ Decrease `clustering_threshold` (e.g., 12.0 → 8.0)
- ✅ Add more discriminative features
- ✅ Use different linkage method (e.g., 'complete' instead of 'ward')

#### Problem: No Goals in Any Cluster
**Solution:**
- ✅ Check `min_forward_progress` (may be too high)
- ✅ Verify goal events in source data
- ✅ Lower duration thresholds to capture quick goals

### Performance Optimization

#### For Large Datasets (10,000+ plays)

**Option 1: Faster Clustering**
```python
# Use mini-batch k-means instead
from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans

kmeans = MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=20, batch_size=1000)
labels = kmeans.fit_predict(feature_matrix)
```

**Option 2: Dimensionality Reduction**
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Reduce 13 features to 5
pca = PCA(n_components=5)
reduced_features = pca.fit_transform(feature_matrix)
```

**Option 3: Sampling**
```python
# Analyze subset of plays
import random
sample_plays = random.sample(all_plays, 5000)
```

### Validation Techniques

#### Silhouette Score (Cluster Quality)
```python
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

score = silhouette_score(feature_matrix, cluster_labels)
# Score: -1 (poor) to 1 (excellent)
# Good clusters: > 0.5
```

#### Elbow Method (Optimal Threshold)
```python
# Try different thresholds
thresholds = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
for t in thresholds:
    clusters = cluster_plays(plays, threshold=t)
    print(f"Threshold {t}: {len(clusters)} clusters")
```

### Event Types Reference

| Code | Event Type | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| PA | Pass | Player passes ball to teammate |
| CR | Cross | Cross from wing into box |
| SH | Shot | Shot at goal |
| IT | Interception/Touch | Ball touched/intercepted |
| DR | Dribble | Player dribbles with ball |
| LO | Loss | Possession lost |
| CA | Clearance | Defensive clearance |
| TA | Tackle | Defensive tackle |
| TC | Touch | General touch |
| CH | Challenge | Challenge for ball |

### Similarity Calculation

```python
def calculate_similarity(play1, play2) -> float:
    """
    Calculate similarity score between plays.
    
    Returns: 0.0 (very different) to 1.0 (identical)
    """
    vec1 = get_feature_vector(play1)
    vec2 = get_feature_vector(play2)
    
    # Euclidean distance
    distance = np.linalg.norm(vec1 - vec2)
    
    # Normalize to 0-1 similarity
    max_distance = 100.0
    similarity = 1.0 - min(distance / max_distance, 1.0)
    
    return similarity
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No plays extracted"
- ✅ Check JSON format matches StatsBomb schema
- ✅ Verify `min_forward_progress` not too high
- ✅ Check duration thresholds

#### "Only 1 cluster found"
- ✅ Decrease `clustering_threshold`
- ✅ Check feature variance (may need more features)
- ✅ Verify plays have diverse characteristics

#### GUI not responding
- ✅ Check for long-running analysis (large datasets)
- ✅ Verify matplotlib backend compatibility
- ✅ Try running analysis in command line first

#### Field plots not showing
- ✅ Update matplotlib: `pip install -U matplotlib`
- ✅ Check TkAgg backend: `matplotlib.use('TkAgg')`
